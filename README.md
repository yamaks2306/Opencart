## How does it work? ##

The Buyer adds items into the cart and prepares the order. Using API requests, the store generates crypto (BTC, LTC, BCH, Doge) addresses for payment and shows a QR code. Then, the buyer scans the QR code and pays for the order. This transaction goes to the blockchain. The payment gateway immediately notifies the store about the payment. The store completes the transaction.
